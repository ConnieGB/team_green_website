# team_green_website
CFG website project about vegetarianism and veganism

Any updates, add onto here

So at the moment we think the different pages are going to be:
homepage; with
  myths debunked
    use the grid in css bootstrap as a way to organise it, or the carousel example on bootstrap. have the myths as each section underneath with the pictures scrolling along the tip
      try and put 'The Lettuce Life' in the navbar, maybe keep the little header before the carousel
  nutritional benefits
  sign up to our newsletter, link to facebook etc. (doesn't have to be legit)
recipe page; split into
  cheap recipes
  quick recipes
  nutritional recipes
  some kind of API about food recipes (on this website https://developer.yummly.com/)
get inspired page; with
  people who are championing these types of diets
    use featurette headings as a way to organise it
  link to their Twitter
  If hover over someone, focus' on them or something

I think if we try to do anymore it will get too complicated, and it would be better to do less but make it amazing!
