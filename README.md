# team_green_website
CFG website project about vegetarianism and veganism


so at the moment we think the different pages are going to be:
homepage; with
  myths debunked
  nutritional benefits
  sign up to our newsletter
recipe page; split into
  cheap recipes
  quick recipes
  nutritional recipes
get inspired page; with
  people who are championing these types of diets

I think if we try to do anymore it will get too complicated, and it would be better to to less but make it amazing!
