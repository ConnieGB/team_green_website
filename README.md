Any updates, add onto here

rgb(82,221,178); the color of the lettuce leaf

So at the moment we think the different pages are going to be:
homepage; with
  myths debunked
    use the grid in css bootstrap as a way to organise it, or the carousel example on bootstrap. have the myths as each section underneath with the pictures scrolling along the tip
      try and put 'The Lettuce Life' in the navbar, maybe keep the little header before the carousel
  nutritional benefits
  sign up to our newsletter, link to facebook etc. (doesn't have to be legit)
recipe page; split into
  cheap recipes
  quick recipes
  nutritional recipes
  some kind of API about food recipes (on this website https://developer.yummly.com/)
get inspired page; with
  people who are championing these types of diets
    use featurette headings as a way to organise it
    The Mcartney's (veg), Drake (veg), Damon Albarn (veg), Peter Dinklage (veg), Forest Whitaker (veg), Leonardo di Caprio (veg, rumoured to be vegan), Joanna Lumley (veg)
    Evanna Lynch (vegan), Sara Pascoe (vegan), Liam Hemsworth(vegan), Simon Amstell (vegan), Venus and Serena Williams (vegan), John Joseph (vegan), Benedict Cumberbatch (vegan),
  link to their Twitter
  If hover over someone, focus' on them or something

I think if we try to do anymore it will get too complicated, and it would be better to do less but make it amazing!
